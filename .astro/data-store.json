I’m Lorenzo Iovino.\n\nI’m a Software Engineer (that’s my job), but I don’t like to define myself only with a role title. I’m a curious person and I always jump between code, ideas, and side passions.\n\nI was born in December 1988 and since then I’ve been basically chasing two things: understanding how things work, and building things that are useful (or just fun).\n\nThis page is a small recap of my story. Nothing special, just me.\n\n## Childhood Nostalgia\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"float-right img-medium\">\n  \u003Cimg src=\"/photos/me-baby.jpg\" alt=\"Super young software developer with an Apple II\" class=\"float-right img-medium\" />\n  \u003Cem class=\"text-sm block mt-2\">Super young software developer with an Apple II\u003C/em>\n\u003C/div>\n\nMy first “wow” moment with computers was very early. I was around 4 years old and I was playing Prince of Persia on an Apple II.\n\nFrom that moment, computers never really left my life. Today they are my work, but also the main thing I enjoy.\n\nI grew up in Ispica, in the south of Sicily. My days were simple: school, videogames, and football with friends. Honestly, it was a good life.\n\nIspica is slow, warm, and beautiful. When I was a kid I didn’t see it that way. I wanted to escape. I was dreaming about big cities, more people, more things happening, more opportunities.\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"float-left img-medium\">\n  \u003Cimg src=\"/photos/pokemon.jpg\" alt=\"Pokemon Yellow and Game Boy Advance\" class=\"float-left img-medium\" />\n  \u003Cem class=\"text-sm block mt-2\">Pokemon Yellow and Game Boy Advance\u003C/em>\n\u003C/div>\n\nThen came Pokemon, Nintendo consoles, and long afternoons with friends. And at some point, I started to get curious about what was “behind” games and computers. That curiosity slowly became programming.\n\nWhen I was 15 I discovered rock music and it hit me hard. I bought a guitar and I started learning (very badly at the beginning) but I loved it.\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"float-right img-medium\">\n  \u003Cimg src=\"/photos/me-guitar-17.jpg\" alt=\"My dream guitar Fender stratocaster\" class=\"float-right img-medium\" />\n  \u003Cem class=\"text-sm block mt-2\">My dream guitar \"Fender stratocaster\"\u003C/em>\n\u003C/div>\n\nGames + music = I became a classic nerd. I wanted to understand computers, programming languages, and all the “magic” under the hood.\n\nAt 17 I also discovered Magic: The Gathering. It became another obsession for a while. I still play sometimes, just for fun.\n\n## University and Personal Growth\n\nI studied Computer Science at the University of Pisa. It was not a straight path.\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"float-right img-medium\">\n  \u003Cimg src=\"/photos/me-cc.jpg\" alt=\"Me burning out studying\" class=\"float-right img-medium\" />\n  \u003Cem class=\"text-sm block mt-2\">Me burning out studying Computability and Complexity exam\u003C/em>\n\u003C/div>\n\nI read a lot (often not the books suggested by professors), I failed exams, I repeated exams, I took online courses, I attended workshops… I was trying to understand what “computer science” really is.\n\nAnd yes, I still have mixed feelings about Computability and Complexity. 😅\n\nIt took me 12 years to finish my Bachelor. Not proud of the timeline, but I’m proud I didn’t quit.\n\nMoving to Pisa was not only about studying. It was also my first real “life outside Sicily” experience, and I needed that.\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"float-left img-medium\">\n  \u003Cimg src=\"/photos/goliardia.jpg\" alt=\"My student hat goliardo\" class=\"float-left img-medium\" />\n  \u003Cem class=\"text-sm block mt-2\">My student hat (that's not a hat) \"goliardo\"\u003C/em>\n\u003C/div>\n\nUniversity years for me were also: meeting people, spending time around the city, goliardia culture, wine sommelier course (yes), concerts, small music clubs, and long talks with strangers during aperitivo.\n\nThat period also started my love for traveling. Seeing different cultures in real life changes your brain.\n\n## Embarking on Hackathon Adventures\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"float-right img-small\">\n  \u003Cimg src=\"/photos/me-moverio.jpg\" alt=\"Me wearing moverio smart glasses\" class=\"float-right img-small\" />\n  \u003Cem class=\"text-sm block mt-2\">Me wearing moverio smart glasses\u003C/em>\n\u003C/div>\n\nMy first hackathon was organized by [Vargroup](https://www.vargroup.it/).\n\nWe were a random team: nobody knew each other. But in 24 hours we built a Proof of Concept + a business idea for a retail app for furniture.\n\nIt was made for Epson Moverio Smartglass: the idea was to let people “place” furniture in their home in a virtual way.\n\nThat experience made me addicted to hackathons. After that I joined other events like Hackaton Toscana (mobility) and also some game jams. Every time you learn something new, and you also learn a lot about teamwork under pressure.\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"w-full\">\n  \u003Cimg src=\"/photos/game-jam.jpg\" alt=\"Me and the team presenting the game\" class=\"img-hero\" />\n  \u003Cem class=\"text-sm block mt-2\">Me and the team presenting the game developed\u003C/em>\n\u003C/div>\n\n*Gameplay of our game \"Oh No My Husband is coming\" developed for GGJ 2015: [Youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/embed/z1Kn6agAujI)*\n\n## Erasmus Project in Valencia\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"float-right img-large\">\n  \u003Cimg src=\"/photos/valencia-turia.jpg\" alt=\"Beautiful sunny day in Valencia\" class=\"float-right img-large\" />\n  \u003Cem class=\"text-sm block mt-2\">Beautiful sunny day in Valencia\u003C/em>\n\u003C/div>\n\nA big turning point was my Erasmus in Valencia.\n\nI kept studying Computer Science at Universidad Politecnica, met people from everywhere, and got exposed to different cultures and languages.\n\nThe tech environment there felt different compared to Italy. In that period there was a lot of energy: startups, new ideas, and a strong feeling that people wanted to build things.\n\nValencia also helped me grow as a person. New country, new habits, new friends, new perspective.\n\n## Embracing the Tranquility of Sicily\n\nAt some point I decided to go back to Sicily.\n\nNot as a “I give up” move. More like: I want a different balance.\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"float-left img-medium\">\n  \u003Cimg src=\"/photos/remote.jpg\" alt=\"Working remote watching the sea\" class=\"float-left img-medium\" />\n  \u003Cem class=\"text-sm block mt-2\">Working remote watching the sea\u003C/em>\n\u003C/div>\n\nI lived the fast pace, the rush, the always-online mindset. Coming back here was intentional: less noise, more space, more time.\n\nI work remote, and Sicily is perfect for that. Life is slower. Sometimes it’s frustrating, but often it’s exactly what I need.\n\nTime here feels different. You can actually breathe. You can have “nothing special” days, and those days can still feel good.\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"w-full\">\n  \u003Cimg src=\"/photos/dogs.jpg\" alt=\"My wineyard\" class=\"img-hero\" />\n  \u003Cem class=\"text-sm block mt-2\">My wineyard\u003C/em>\n\u003C/div>\n\nFamily is a big part of my life here. And I also started a side project with my sister (she’s an agronomist): we planted a small vineyard near the sea and we started producing our own wine.\n\nThat project became [www.netum.it](https://netum.it/). It’s small (1 hectare), limited bottles, but it’s something we built together and I love it.\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"float-right img-small\">\n  \u003Cimg src=\"/photos/wine.jpg\" alt=\"The wine produced Zia Lina\" class=\"float-right img-small\" />\n  \u003Cem class=\"text-sm block mt-2\">The wine produced \"Zia Lina\"\u003C/em>\n\u003C/div>\n\nAnd yes: food. Sicily is crazy for food. It’s not even a “food culture”, it’s basically a religion.\n\n*(No food photos here. I’m not a food blogger. But trust me.)*\n\nFor me, living here is a reminder: success is not only about projects and code. It’s also about how you live your days.\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"w-full\">\n  \u003Cimg src=\"/photos/modica.jpg\" alt=\"Modica view from my house\" class=\"img-hero\" />\n  \u003Cem class=\"text-sm block mt-2\">Modica view from my house\u003C/em>\n\u003C/div>\n\n## Life at 35\n\nToday I’m a husband (to my wife Amanda) and a dad (to our little Leonardo).\n\nLife changed a lot, in a good way.
