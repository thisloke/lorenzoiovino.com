## Hello world!

Hi! I’m Lorenzo Iovino.

I’m a Software Engineer (that’s my job), but I don’t like to define myself only with a role title. I’m a curious person and I always jump between code, ideas, and side passions.

I was born in December 1988 and since then I’ve been basically chasing two things: understanding how things work, and building things that are useful (or just fun).

This page is a small recap of my story. Nothing special, just me.

## Childhood Nostalgia

  <em class="text-sm block mt-2">Super young software geek with an Apple II</em>
</div>

My first “wow” moment with computers was very early. I was around 4 years old and I was playing Prince of Persia on an Apple II.

From that moment, computers never really left my life. Today they are my work, but also the main thing I enjoy.

I grew up in Ispica, in the south of Sicily. My days were simple: school, videogames, and football with friends. Honestly, it was a good life.

Ispica is slow, warm, and beautiful. When I was a kid I didn’t see it that way. I wanted to escape. I was dreaming about big cities, more people, more things happening, more opportunities.

<div class="float-left img-medium">

  <em class="text-sm block mt-2">Pokemon Yellow and Game Boy Advance</em>
</div>

Then came Pokemon, Nintendo consoles, and long afternoons with friends. And at some point, I started to get curious about what was “behind” games and computers. That curiosity slowly became programming.

When I was 15 I discovered rock music and it hit me hard. I bought a guitar and I started learning (very badly at the beginning) but I loved it.

  <em class="text-sm block mt-2">My dream guitar "Fender stratocaster"</em>
</div>

Games + music = I became a classic nerd. I wanted to understand computers, programming languages, and all the “magic” under the hood.

At 17 I also discovered Magic: The Gathering. It became another obsession for a while. I still play sometimes, just for fun.

## University and Personal Growth

I studied Computer Science at the University of Pisa. It was not a straight path.

<div class="float-right img-medium">
  <Image src={meCC} alt="Me burning out studying" class="float-right img-medium" width={400} height={300} quality={85} format="webp" />
  <em class="text-sm block mt-2">Me burning out studying Computability and Complexity exam</em>
</div>

I read a lot (often not the books suggested by professors), I failed exams, I repeated exams, I took online courses, I attended workshops… I was trying to understand what “computer science” really is.

And yes, I still have mixed feelings about Computability and Complexity. 😅

It took me 12 years to finish my Bachelor. Not proud of the timeline, but I’m proud I didn’t quit.

Moving to Pisa was not only about studying. It was also my first real “life outside Sicily” experience, and I needed that.

<div class="float-left img-medium">

  <em class="text-sm block mt-2">My student hat (that's not a hat) "goliardo"</em>
</div>

University years for me were also: meeting people, spending time around the city, goliardia culture, wine sommelier course (yes), concerts, small music clubs, and long talks with strangers during aperitivo.

That period also started my love for traveling. Seeing different cultures in real life changes your brain.

## Embarking on Hackathon Adventures

  <em class="text-sm block mt-2">Me wearing moverio smart glasses</em>
</div>

My first hackathon was organized by [Vargroup](https://www.vargroup.it/).

We were a random team: nobody knew each other. But in 24 hours we built a Proof of Concept + a business idea for a retail app for furniture.

It was made for Epson Moverio Smartglass: the idea was to let people “place” furniture in their home in a virtual way.

That experience made me addicted to hackathons. After that I joined other events like Hackaton Toscana (mobility) and also some game jams. Every time you learn something new, and you also learn a lot about teamwork under pressure.

## Erasmus Project in Valencia

</div>

A big turning point was my Erasmus in Valencia.

I kept studying Computer Science at Universidad Politecnica, met people from everywhere, and got exposed to different cultures and languages.

The tech environment there felt different compared to Italy. In that period there was a lot of energy: startups, new ideas, and a strong feeling that people wanted to build things.

Valencia also helped me grow as a person. New country, new habits, new friends, new perspective.

## Embracing the Tranquility of Sicily

At some point I decided to go back to Sicily.

Not as a “I give up” move. More like: I want a different balance.

<div class="float-left img-medium">
  <Image src={remote} alt="Working remote watching the sea" class="float-left img-medium" width={400} height={300} quality={80} format="webp" />
  <em class="text-sm block mt-2">Working remote watching the sea</em>
</div>

I lived the fast pace, the rush, the always-online mindset. Coming back here was intentional: less noise, more space, more time.

I work remote, and Sicily is perfect for that. Life is slower. Sometimes it’s frustrating, but often it’s exactly what I need.

Time here feels different. You can actually breathe. You can have “nothing special” days, and those days can still feel good.

<div class="w-full">
  <Image src={dogs} alt="My wineyard" class="img-hero" width={1200} height={630} quality={80} format="webp" />
  <em class="text-sm block mt-2">My wineyard</em>
</div>

Family is a big part of my life here. And I also started a side project with my sister (she’s an agronomist): we planted a small vineyard near the sea and we started producing our own wine.

That project became [www.netum.it](https://netum.it/). It’s small (1 hectare), limited bottles, but it’s something we built together and I love it.

<div class="float-right img-small">
  <Image src={wine} alt="The wine produced Zia Lina" class="float-right img-small" width={300} height={300} quality={85} format="webp" />
  <em class="text-sm block mt-2">The wine produced "Zia Lina"</em>
</div>

And yes: food. Sicily is crazy for food. It’s not even a “food culture”, it’s basically a religion.

*(No food photos here. I’m not a food blogger. But trust me.)*

For me, living here is a reminder: success is not only about projects and code. It’s also about how you live your days.

## Life at 35

Today I’m a husband (to my wife Amanda) and a dad (to our little Leonardo).

Life changed a lot, in a good way. I still love technology, I still build things, but family gives a different meaning to everything.
