Hi, I’m Lorenzo.

I’ve been thinking about writing for a long time, and I finally decided to publish this blog.
Not to be “a creator” or something like that — just to keep track of what I learn and share it with whoever finds it useful.

## What you will find here

Mostly things around software and the life around it:

- software engineering stuff I face in real projects (architecture, scalability, reliability, messy trade-offs)
- notes about tools / workflows that I actually use
- remote work life (I work from Sicily, sometimes literally with the sea in front)
- learning experiments (Rust, infra, random deep dives)
- and sometimes personal things: family, time, balance, small projects

I don’t have a fixed schedule. I’ll write when I have something real to say.

## Why I’m doing it now

In the last years I built a lot, broke a lot, fixed a lot.
I also changed life (moved, family, new priorities). Writing helps me slow down and put things in order.

Also: many times I solve a problem and then I forget the details after 2 months. This blog is also for future-me.

## If you want to say hi

If something here is useful (or wrong 😅), feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorenzoiovino/).
I’m happy to chat with other engineers, founders, makers, or just curious people.

That’s it. First post done. Now I need to keep going 🙂
