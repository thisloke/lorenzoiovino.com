Most of the internet today feels like soup: warm, endless and somehow always the same.

I’m writing this blog because I don’t want my own thoughts to become soup too.

## The simple reason

AI can write fast. Too fast. Hyper fast... and when everything is “a summary of a summary (of a summary)” we end up with *trash in, trash out*. Not only for models, also for humans!

So I write posts to keep something real on the page, something that has fingerprints, so something that happened for real.
<br/><br/>
Not synthetic. Not “perfect”. Not optimized for vibes. With a lot of errors and bold opinions 😎

## What I mean by “synthetic noise”

By *synthetic noise* I mean content that looks like information, but it’s basically empty.

It’s the stuff that:

- repeats the same ideas with different words
- summarizes other summaries
- avoids details (because details are risky)
- sounds confident even when it’s vague
- is written to fill space

It’s “content-shaped” and not knowledge, not an experience of someboyd. <br/><br/>Sometimes it’s made by AI and sometimes it’s made by humans, copying AI pattern and that’s **even worse**, because it spreads like a virus but is sneaky and very hard to identify!

## The main long-term problem

The main problem is simple:

> **synthetic noise becomes the input of everything else.**

Search results, docs, blog posts, tutorials also internal company docs.
If the web is full of low-value text, then people learn slower, decisions get made on weak info, everyone repeats the same half-truths and real experience gets lost!

For AI models it’s the same idea: trash in, trash out. <br/><br/>
If the training data gets more “soup”, the output gets more “soup”, so it's feedback loop, like a resonating microphone with speaker during a call when you don't use the headphones!


## The real enemy

The worst part is not that the content is wrong, it’s that it’s *vague in a way that looks correct*.

You read it, you think you understood, you feel productive, but you learned nothing.

It gives you the *illusion* of understanding and over time, that illusion makes you lazy in a way that you stop asking “what exactly happened?”, stop demanding for numbers, constraints, trade-offs etc.. and you accept generic advice as if it was universal truth.
<br/><br/>
This is how we and also the future LLM get weaker.

It's not just an human problem, it's also a future LLM-problem!

## What I’m trying to do here in my blog

I know that a *blog* is really anacrhonistic nowadays and probably it's a way to make the LLM stronger and more humanized because i'm providing "human-generated content" to the crawlers and i know that i'm just a drop in the *synthethic sea*, but it's a *drop of myself* that will be digested from an LLM and from some human (if somebody will read) and i'm happy in anycase, because in the worst case i'm contributing fix a problem that at some point we will face it.

Joking a-part, maybe is not-a-problem and i'm just hallucinating 😝 and probably i'm acting like Don Chischiotte.

Re-capping again what this blog is and what the purpose is:

- explain what I built (and what broke)
- write down thoughts
- keep notes and ideas that future-me will actually reuse
- practice writing in English, even if I’m not native


## Closing

This blog is my small effort to dilute the online noise with something that at least tried to be honest.

Not heroic, Just… less soup. 🙂
